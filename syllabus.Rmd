# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences has a hierarchical course structure that requires students to complete certain prerequisite courses before taking upper-level courses.

The department will check student records to ensure completion of course prerequisites.  

# Description of Course {#description}

<mark>INSERT</mark>
The goal of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to child and adolescent psychopathology.
This includes an emphasis on the developmental psychopathology framework and involves thinking critically about the causes, consequences, ongoing questions, and preventative challenges of child psychopathology facing scientists, youth and their families, clinicians, and society.
We apply elements of the developmental psychopathology model to a range of childhood disorders.  Within each syndrome, possible genetic, neurobiological, psychological, familial, and socio-cultural causal factors will be scrutinized.
We will also review and discuss risk and resilience factors for child psychopathology (individual, family, community) as well as models of treatment and prevention.
*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if you are reluctant to examine these topics in a scientific manner.*

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

The specific objectives of this course are for students to:

- Identify the symptoms and course of psychological disorders in childhood
- Develop an understanding of the various risk factors involved in the development of psychopathology 
- Identify factors that may protect against the development of psychopathology during childhood
- Become acquainted with different methods of the treatment and prevention of childhood psychological disorders
- Become familiar with the various research methods used to study the development of psychopathology, including their strengths and limitations
- Read and critique original source articles in developmental psychopathology
- Write an APA-style literature review on a relevant topic in developmental psychopathology
