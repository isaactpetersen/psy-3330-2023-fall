At the time of the make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness at the time of an exam; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
