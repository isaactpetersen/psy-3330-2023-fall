# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences has a hierarchical course structure that requires students to complete certain prerequisite courses before taking upper-level courses.
This course requires successful completion (C- or higher) of Elementary Psychology, Introduction to Clinical Psychology, and Research Methods in Psychology.
The department will check student records to ensure completion of course prerequisites.  

# Description of Course {#description}

This course satisfies the upper-level elective requirement for Psychological and Brain Sciences majors.
Additionally, students with broad interests in health and development will find this course useful. 
The goal of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to child and adolescent psychopathology.
This includes an emphasis on the developmental psychopathology framework and involves thinking critically about the causes, consequences, ongoing questions, and preventative challenges of child psychopathology facing scientists, youth and their families, clinicians, and society. 
We apply elements of the developmental psychopathology model to a range of childhood disorders. 
Within each syndrome, possible genetic, neurobiological, psychological, familial, and socio-cultural causal factors will be scrutinized.
We will also review and discuss risk and resilience factors for child psychopathology (individual, family, community) as well as models of treatment and prevention.
*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if you are reluctant to examine these topics in a scientific manner.*

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Identify the symptoms and course of psychological disorders in childhood
- Distinguish the various risk factors that contribute to psychopathology in childhood.  
- Identify factors that may protect against the development of psychopathology and promote resilience.
- Describe different methods for treatment and prevention of psychological disorders in childhood.
- Critique, analyze, and synthesize original source articles in developmental psychopathology
- Produce an APA-style literature review that integrates empirical findings in developmental psychopathology

# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these procedures](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Please note that collaboration with other classmates on quizzes and during exams is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates to *prepare* for exams (e.g., informal study groups).
Because writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all work submitted by students should be prepared by the student.
Developing strong competencies in these domains will prepare you for a competitive workplace.
Therefore, AI-generated submissions are not permitted and will be treated as plagiarism.

# Course Requirements and Policies {#requirements}

## Lecture {#lecture}

We will meet three times weekly for lectures, at the time and location described [above](#lectureTime).
My powerpoint presentations for the lectures will be posted on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) no later than noon on the day before the lecture (though I may continue to refine the slides up until the time of lecture).
<u>Please note:</u> powerpoint presentations are an outline of my points. 
<u>It is your responsibility to take notes during class.</u>
If you have questions about the lecture notes or need clarification of any of the points, please ask in class or meet with the TA or Professor Petersen during office hours. 
If you miss class and/or need help catching up on the notes, please make an appointment with the TA.

## Attendance and Participation {#attendanceParticipation}

Attendance at lectures is required and will be checked and factored into final grades (see grading section [below](#grading)).
There are 43 lectures during the semester (excluding examinations).
You will receive one point for attendance at each lecture up to 40 points (i.e., you will not receive extra credit for attending all 43 lectures).
<u>Thus, you will not be penalized for missing up to 3 lectures.
However, you will be responsible for learning any material missed for quizzes and exams, and I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures.
Poor lecture attendance is likely to affect the quality of students' work and success in the course.</u>

Students who miss <u>more than 3 lectures</u> due to participation in University activities be will asked to give the instructor a statement <u>before the absence</u> signed by a responsible official that specifies the dates and times the student will miss class.
Authorized activities include participation in athletic teams, the marching band or pep band, debate teams, and other recognized University groups, as well as participation in University field trips, service with the National Guard, and jury duty.
Absences due to illnesses or emergencies (that go over 3 lectures) must be documented with the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and sent to within 48 hours of the absence.
Per university policy, if a student will be absent <u>5 or more consecutive days and the absence is due to illness or other emergency</u>, please contact the Registrar Service Center at (319) 384-4300 or registrar@uiowa.edu.

## Readings {#readings}

Readings from your text are assigned by lecture topic.
You should read and take notes on the material before class.
Past experience has shown that to do well in this class you should read the assigned material, attend lectures and take notes, and review your notes each week.
There is too much material being covered in this class to try to study only by frantic preparation immediately before quizzes and exams.

## Workload {#workload}

This is a 3 semester hour course.
Students should therefore expect to spend [6 additional hours per week](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-workload-guidelines) (outside of class) reading the textbook and articles, reviewing lecture material, preparing for quizzes and exams, and completing writing assignments.

## Quizzes {#quizzes}

Six quizzes will be administered via the [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) website.
Students <u>are</u> allowed to use their textbook and lecture notes on the quizzes.
However, students <u>may not</u> work together on the quizzes.
<u>Questions will be randomized and presented such that students must answer one question at a time (i.e., students may not go back to a previous question in the quiz).</u>
Quizzes will consist of approximately 20â€“30 multiple choice or very short answer questions.
Although students may take the quiz at any time when it is available, students must complete the quiz within <u>2 hours</u>. 
We will not accept late responses or multiple submissions.
Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
We will not accept excused absences for quizzes because (a) you have a week to complete the quiz (and can submit it at any point during that week), and (b) we drop your lowest quiz score.
Each quiz will be weighted the same in the final grade.

Although students will have access to their course materials during the quiz, reading and advanced preparation will be necessary to do well on the quizzes.
<u>Material for quiz questions will be taken from required readings (texts and articles) as well as from lecture material.</u>
Quiz due dates and topics will be announced in class and via email and are listed below.
All quizzes should be submitted to [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) by 11:59 p.m. on the due date.

| Quiz # | Dates Available | Topics Covered                                                 |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 9/4 â€“ 9/11      | History/D&P Model, Theories & Causes, Research with Children   |
| 2      | 9/22 â€“ 9/29     | ADHD, ASD, Intellectual Disability, Specific Learning Disorder |
| 3      | 10/20 â€“ 10/27   | CD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar                               |
| 4      | 11/1 â€“ 11/8     | Elimination, Eating, Substance-Related Disorders, Self-Injury  |
| 5      | 11/15 â€“ 11/29   | Maltreatment and Resilience                                    |
| 6      | 12/1 â€“ 12/8     | Levels of Analysis Articles, Prevention                        |

## Examinations {#exams}

There will be 2 exams; one mid-term exam and one non-cumulative final exam.
Each exam will emphasize information presented for the half of the class that precedes it.
However, some integration of information across sections will be required for questions on the final exam.
Exams will consist of short-answer and multiple choice questions based upon both readings (texts and articles) and the lecture material.
Exam dates are listed below.

**Exam 1 (Mid-Term Exam):	Wednesday, October 4, 2023 during class**\
**Exam 2 (Final Exam): TBD during finals week** (the date, time, and location will be announced by the 5th week of class by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences)

### Missing Exams {#missingExams}

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
<u>In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen or the TA</u>.

## Literature Critiques {#litCritiques}

You will be required to complete two literature critique assignments.
These assignments are designed to help you learn to critically analyze original source articles in written form.
Both assignments involve providing a critique of a research article (Ra et al., 2018 â€“ Article #2, and Christakis et al., 2004 â€“ Article #3).
Both papers should be 2â€“3 pages long (double-spaced, APA format, 12-point Times New Roman font) and will be turned in via [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
Each should be in essay form and carefully proofread for spelling and grammatical errors.
<u>Students may not work together on the critiques.</u>
More information on how to structure the critiques will be provided in class.
Note: Turnitin will be used via [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) to check for plagiarism of a fellow student and from the internet.
**The critiques are due on Monday, August 28 and Friday, September 8 by 11:59 p.m.**

## Literature Review {#litReview}

You will be required to write a <u>literature review</u> on a topic related to child psychopathology.
The topic of the paper is completely up to the student; the only requirement is that it must be relevant to psychopathology in children or adolescents.
The paper must include a review and analysis of at least 5 empirical articles on the topic, published since 2000.
You are encouraged to work with the [UI Writing Center](https://writingcenter.uiowa.edu) in revising your paper.

### Format

The paper should have five sections:

1. Cover Letter, described [here](#stage6)
1. Title Page
1. Abstract
1. Main body
1. References

The main body of the paper should be <u>10â€“12 pages</u>, excluding the cover letter, title page, abstract, and references.
The text should be double-spaced, in [APA format](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html), and in 12-point Times New Roman font.
For sample papers in APA format, see [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_sample_paper.html).

### Stages

#### Overview

This paper will be completed in 6 stages, all uploaded to [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu):

1. [Generate a topic](#stage1)
1. [Identify articles](#stage2)
1. [Understand findings from articles](#stage3)
1. [Write a complete draft](#stage4)
1. [Give and receive feedback](#stage5)
1. [Incorporate feedback and polish writing](#stage6)

The goals of this project are for each student to produce a thoughtful paper that describes an aspect of this course that captured their interest and to gain more experience with scientific writing.
Each stage of the process will be discussed in class, so attendance is critical.
Additionally, grading rubrics for each stage will be posted so that students understand the basis for evaluation of each stage of the assignment.
Successful completion of this assignment requires students to adhere closely to the deadlines outlined.
<u>For this reason, substantial penalties will be applied to all late work (20% off final grade for each day the assignment is late).
Further, to make sure the peer review process for first drafts is successful, any first drafts submitted after the deadline of Friday, November 3 will receive a zero and will not receive a peer review (the student will still receive instructor feedback).
If you have concerns about meeting one of the literature review deadlines, please contact Professor Petesen or the TA as soon as possible to discuss.</u>
All assignments should be uploaded to [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) by 11:59 p.m. on the due date.

The stagesâ€”and deadlinesâ€”are described below:

#### Deadlines {#deadlines}

The workflow of the literature review stages, their respective percentages in the total literature review grade, and relevant due dates are listed below.

| Stage | Assignment Description | Percent | Due Date |
|-------|------------------------|---------|----------|
| 1     | **Develop a topic description (2 sentences) and 3â€“5 keywords** you will then use to conduct a literature search using [Google Scholar](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/GoogleSch), [PsycINFO](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/apa/psycinfo), and/or [PubMed](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/nlm/pubmed). | 2.5% | 9/15  |
| 2     | **Identify and generate a list of 5 empirical articles** that you will include in your review based on your searches of [Google Scholar](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/GoogleSch), [PsycINFO](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/apa/psycinfo), and/or [PubMed](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/nlm/pubmed).    | 2.5% | 9/25  |
| 3     | **Write brief summaries** of each of the 5 empirical articles that includes clear descriptions of both the methodology and relevant findings. | 10%  | 10/16 |
| 4     | **Compose a complete first draft** of the review that includes an introduction with thesis, description, critique, and integration of the 5 empirical studies. | 25%  | 11/3  |
| 5a    | Peer reviews are assigned. | â€“  | 11/6 |
| 5b    | **Give feedback** by providing anonymous peer review of another student's paper. | 10%  | 11/27 |
| 5c    | **Receive feedback** from peer and from instructor. | â€“ | 11/29 |
| 6     | **Incorporate feedback and produce a final document.** | 50%  | 12/8  |

#### Stage 1: Generate a Topic {#stage1}

You will first develop a topic and a set of keywords for your paper.
For the review format, this involves generating a specific topic and keywords you will then use to conduct a literature search using [Google Scholar](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/GoogleSch), [PsycINFO](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/apa/psycinfo), and/or [PubMed](http://purl.lib.uiowa.edu/nlm/pubmed).
We will discuss strategies for generating topics and keywords in class, and examples will be provided.
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will turn in a summary of your research topic (1â€“2 sentences) and a list of keywords that will start your literature search</u>.

#### Stage 2: Identify Articles {#stage2}

After your topic has been approved, you will then conduct a search to identify the articles for your paper.
You will search PsychINFO or PubMed and identify a minimum of five empirical articles that are all relevant to your topic.
As we will discuss in class, it is important to define your topic carefully so that all of your identified articles are addressing common components.
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will turn in your list of articles</u>. 

#### Stage 3: Understand Findings from Articles {#stage3}

Once you have identified the five papers you wish to write about, you will then produce brief summaries of each article that include a description of the methods employed by the researchers and their basic findings (2â€“4 paragraphs per article for each of your five articles).
You will also include your reference list, in APA style.
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will turn in your article summaries</u>.

#### Stage 4: Write a Complete Draft {#stage4}

Next, you will write and turn in a complete draft of your paper.
The systematic review should include both description of the empirical studies you've included as well as analysis, critique, and integration of findings.
For this stage, you will also generate a thesis that describes the overall message of your review and you will work to demonstrate how each article is (or is not) supportive of your thesis.
The goal of this stage is to develop your ideas and argument so that you can receive feedback.
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will turn in your first draft of the paper.
Note: you must turn in a complete draft of your paperâ€”not an outline.</u>

#### Stage 5: Give and Receiving Feedback {#stage5}

Following submission of your first draft, all students will receive detailed feedback from the instructor, which will include critique of content, organization, and argument.
Additionally each student will complete an anonymous peer review of a fellow student's paper (your draft will also be peer reviewed).
Peer reviews will be blinded and only I (the instructor) will know which papers belong to which students.
Reviews will be assigned in class.
More details about providing an appropriate review and the formatting will be provided in class.
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will turn in your review of the peer's paper.</u>
The instructor will then re-distribute the peer reviews to authors.  

#### Stage 6: Incorporating Feedback and Polishing Writing {#stage6}

You will receive comments from the instructor and from your peer reviewer via email.
You will then use these comments to revise your paper.
Your final paper must include a <u>cover letter</u> that details the changes you made to your draft based on feedback from the instructor as well as from your peer reviewer.
<u>Additionally, students are encouraged to meet with the TA during the week of November 27 to review their feedback and discuss plans for revision.</u>
<u>By the [deadline](#deadlines), you will submit the literature review</u>.
The literature review should include the manuscript itself as well as a cover letter describing the changes made in response to comments from the instructor and the peer reviewer.

# Grading {#grading}

Final grades will be assigned at the end of the semester on the basis of your total percentage of points earned on quizzes, examinations, written assignments, and lecture attendance, as detailed below.
Grades will be assigned on an absolute scale (criterion-referenced grading; see below); course grades will not be curved.
No extra-credit opportunities are available for this course.
Please note: As a matter of fairness to all students, I assign grades based on performance and do not negotiate grades.
Additionally, a penalty of 20% per day will be applied to all assignments turned in late.
Final grades will be assigned based on the following ranges:

| Grade | Percent |
|:------|:--------|
| A+    | 97â€“100% |
| A     | 93â€“96   |
| A-    | 90â€“92   |
| B+    | 87â€“89   |
| B     | 83â€“86   |
| B-    | 80â€“82   |
| C+    | 77â€“79   |
| C     | 73â€“76   |
| C-    | 70â€“72   |
| D+    | 67â€“69   |
| D     | 63â€“66   |
| D-    | 60â€“62   |
| F     | 0â€“59    |

I round up from .5 when determining final grades.
For example, a course percent of 79.50 would receive a B-, whereas a course percent of 79.49 would receive a C+.

The relative contribution of each component to your final grade is as follows:

- 5%    Lecture Attendance
- 10%   Literature Critiques (2 at 5% each)
- 20%   Exam 1 (Mid-Term)
- 20%   Exam 2 (Final)
- 15%   Quizzes (5 quizzes after dropping lowest quiz score, 3% each)
- 30%   Literature Review
