# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences has a hierarchical course structure that requires students to complete certain prerequisite courses before taking upper-level courses.
This course requires successful completion (C- or higher) of Elementary Psychology, Introduction to Clinical Psychology, and Research Methods in Psychology.
The department will check student records to ensure completion of course prerequisites.  

# Description of Course {#description}

This course satisfies the upper-level elective requirement for Psychological and Brain Sciences majors.
Additionally, students with broad interests in health and development will find this course useful. 
The goal of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to child and adolescent psychopathology.
This includes an emphasis on the developmental psychopathology framework and involves thinking critically about the causes, consequences, ongoing questions, and preventative challenges of child psychopathology facing scientists, youth and their families, clinicians, and society. 
We apply elements of the developmental psychopathology model to a range of childhood disorders. 
Within each syndrome, possible genetic, neurobiological, psychological, familial, and socio-cultural causal factors will be scrutinized.
We will also review and discuss risk and resilience factors for child psychopathology (individual, family, community) as well as models of treatment and prevention.
*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if you are reluctant to examine these topics in a scientific manner.*

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Identify the symptoms and course of psychological disorders in childhood
- Distinguish the various risk factors that contribute to psychopathology in childhood.  
- Identify factors that may protect against the development of psychopathology and promote resilience.
- Describe different methods for treatment and prevention of psychological disorders in childhood.
- Critique, analyze, and synthesize original source articles in developmental psychopathology
- Produce an APA-style literature review that integrates empirical findings in developmental psychopathology

# Required Textbook and Materials {#textbook}

To provide you with a textbook with as low a cost as possible, you will be provided an eText of the following book via ICON Direct, unless you decline:

**Mash, E. J., Wolfe, D. A., & Williams, K. N. (2023). *Childhood psychopathology* (8th Ed.). Cengage.**

However, if you want to purchase a hardcopy of the textbook (for a higher cost) you may decline the eText via ICON Direct.

In addition to the textbook, additional required readings for selected topics will include the following articles.

# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these procedures](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Please note that collaboration with other classmates on quizzes and during exams is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates to *prepare* for exams (e.g., informal study groups).

# Course Requirements and Policies {#requirements}

## Lecture {#lecture}

We will meet three times weekly for lectures, at the time and location described [above](#lectureTime).
My powerpoint presentations for the lectures will be posted on the ICON course website no later than noon on the day before the lecture.
<u>Please note:</u> powerpoint presentations are an outline of my points. 
<u>It is your responsibility to take notes during class.</u>
If you have questions about the lecture notes or need clarification of any of the points, please ask in class or meet with the TA or me during office hours. 
If you miss class and/or need help catching up on the notes, please make an appointment with the TA.

## Attendance and Participation {#attendanceParticipation}

Attendance at lectures is required and will be checked and factored into final grades (see grading section below).
There are 43 lectures during the semester (excluding examinations).
You will receive one point for attendance at each lecture up to 40 points (i.e., you will not receive extra credit for attending all 43 lectures).
<u>Thus, you will not be penalized for missing up to 3 lectures.
However, you will be responsible for learning any material missed for quizzes and exams, and I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures.
Poor lecture attendance is likely to affect the quality of students' work and success in the course.</u>

Students who miss <u>more than 3 lectures</u> due to participation in University activities be will asked to give the instructor a statement <u>before the absence</u> signed by a responsible official that specifies the dates and times the student will miss class.
Authorized activities include participation in athletic teams, the marching band or pep band, debate teams, and other recognized University groups, as well as participation in University field trips, service with the National Guard, and jury duty.
Absences due to illnesses or emergencies (that go over 3 lectures) must be documented with the University of Iowa Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class available from the registrar's website.
Per university policy, if a student will be absent <u>5 or more consecutive days and the absence is due to illness or other emergency</u>, please contact the Registrar Service Center at (319) 384-4300 or registrar@uiowa.edu.

## Readings {#readings}

Readings from your text are assigned by lecture topic.
You should read and take notes on the material before class.
Past experience has shown that to do well in this class you should read the assigned material, attend lectures and take notes, and review your notes each week.
There is too much material being covered in this class to try to study only by frantic preparation immediately before quizzes and exams.

## Workload {#workload}

This is a 3 semester hour course.
Students should therefore expect to spend [6 additional hours per week](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-workload-guidelines) (outside of class) reading the textbook and articles, reviewing lecture material, preparing for quizzes and exams, and completing writing assignments.

## Quizzes {#quizzes}

Six quizzes will be administered via the ICON website.
Students <u>are</u> allowed to use their textbook and lecture notes on the quizzes.
However, students <u>may not</u> work together on the quizzes.
<u>Questions will be randomized and presented such that students must answer one question at a time (i.e., students may not go back to a previous question in the quiz).</u>
Quizzes will consist of approximately 20â€“30 multiple choice or very short answer questions.
While students may take the quiz at any time when it is available, students must complete the quiz within <u>2 hours</u>. 
We will not accept late responses or multiple submissions.
Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
We will not accept excused absences for quizzes because (a) you have a week to complete the quiz (and can submit it at any point during that week), and (b) we drop your lowest quiz score.
Each quiz will be weighted the same in the final grade.

Although students will have access to their course materials during the quiz, reading and advanced preparation will be necessary to do well on the quizzes.
<u>Material for quiz questions will be taken from required readings (texts and articles) as well as from lecture material.</u>
Quiz due dates and topics will be announced in class and via email and are listed below.

|     Quiz #    |     Dates Available    |     Topics Covered                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1         |     1/28 â€“ 2/4         |     History/D&P Model, Theories & Causes, Research   with Children      |
|     2         |     2/15 â€“ 2/22        |     ADHD, ASD, Intellectual Disability, Specific Learning   Disorder    |
|     3         |     3/15 â€“ 3/29        |     CD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar                                    |

|     6*        |     4/26 â€“ 5/3         |     Levels of Analysis Articles, Prevention                             |

## Examinations {#exams}

There will be 2 exams; one mid-term exam and one non-cumulative final exam.
Each exam will emphasize information presented for the half of the class that precedes it.
However, some integration of information across sections will be required for questions on the final exam.
Exams will consist of short-answer and multiple choice questions based upon both readings (texts and articles) and the lecture material.
Exam dates are listed below.

**Exam 1 (Mid-Term Exam):	Wednesday, February 27, 2023 during class**\
**Exam 2 (Final Exam): TBD during finals week** (the date, time, and location will be announced by the 5th week of class by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences)

### Missing Exams {#missingExams}

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
At the time of the make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness at the time of an exam; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
<u>In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must bring an acceptable form of documentation for the excused absence to the make-up exam</u>.

## Literature Critiques {#litCritiques}

You will be required to complete two literature critique assignments.
These assignments are designed to help you learn to critically analyze original source articles in written form.
Both assignments involve providing a critique of a research article (Ra et al., 2018 â€“ Article 2, and Christakis et al., 2004 â€“ Article #3).
Both papers should be 2-3 pages long (double-spaced, 12-point font) and will be turned in via ICON.
Each should be in essay form and carefully proofread for spelling and grammatical errors.
<u>Students may not work together on the critiques.</u>
More information on how to structure the critiques will be provided in class.
Note: Turnitin will be used via ICON to check for plagiarism of a fellow student and from the internet.
**The critiques are due on Wednesday, January 23 and Friday, February 1 by 11:59 p.m.**

## Literature Review {#litReview}

You will be required to write a <u>10â€“12 page literature review</u> on a topic related to child psychopathology.
The topic of the paper is completely up to the student; the only requirement is that it must be relevant to psychopathology in children or adolescents.
The paper must include a systematic review and analysis of at least 5 empirical articles on the topic, published since 2000.
This paper will be completed in 5 stages, all uploaded to ICON:

1. [Generating a topic](#stage1)
1. [Identifying articles and understanding findings](#stage2)
1. [Writing a complete draft](#stage3)
1. [Giving and receiving feedback](#stage4)
1. [Incorporating feedback and polishing writing](#stage5)

The goals of this project are for each student to produce a thoughtful paper that describes an aspect of this course that captured their interest and to gain more experience with scientific writing.
Each stage of the process will be discussed in class, so attendance is critical.
Additionally, grading rubrics for each stage will be posted so that students understand the basis for evaluation of each stage of the assignment.
Successful completion of this assignment requires students to adhere closely to the deadlines outlined.
<u>For this reason, substantial penalties will be applied to all late work (20% off final grade for each day the assignment is late).
Further, to make sure the peer review process for first drafts is successful, any first drafts submitted after the deadline of Friday, April 5 will receive a zero and will not receive a peer review (the student will still receive instructor feedback).
If you have concerns about meeting one of the literature review deadlines, please contact Professor Petesen or the TA as soon as possible to discuss.</u>

The stagesâ€”and deadlinesâ€”are described below:

### Stage 1: Generating a Topic {#stage1}

You will first develop a topic and a set of keywords for your paper.
For the review format, this involves generating a specific topic and keywords you will then use to conduct a literature search using PsycINFO or PubMed.
We will discuss strategies for generating topics and keywords in class and examples will be provided.
<u>You will turn in a summary of your research topic (1â€“2 sentences) and a list of keywords that will start your search by **Friday, February 8**</u> (*2.5% of literature review grade*).

### Stage 2: Identifying Articles and Understanding Findings {#stage2}

After your topic has been approved, you will then conduct a search to identify the articles for your paper.
You will search PsychINFO or PubMed and identify a minimum of five empirical articles that are all relevant to your topic.
As we will discuss in class, it is important to define your topic carefully so that all of your identified articles are addressing common components.
<u>You will turn in your list of articles by **Monday, February 18**</u> (*2.5% of literature review grade*). 

Once you have identified the five papers you wish to write about, you will then produce brief summaries of each article that include a description of the methods employed by the researchers and their basic findings (2â€“4 paragraphs per article for each of your five articles).
You will also include your reference list, in APA style.
<u>The article summaries are due by **Monday, March 11**</u> (*10% of literature review grade*).

### Stage 3: Writing a Complete Draft {#stage3}

Next, you will write and turn in a complete draft of your paper.
The systematic review should include both description of the empirical studies you've included as well as analysis, critique, and integration of findings.
For this stage, you will also generate a thesis that describes the overall message of your review and you will work to demonstrate how each article is (or is not) supportive of your thesis.
The goal of this stage is to develop your ideas and argument so that you can receive feedback.
<u>Note: you must turn in a complete draft of your paperâ€”not an outline.
The first draft is due **Friday, April 5**.</u>
For this portion of the assignment, you will upload an electronic version to your ICON dropbox (*25% of literature review grade*).

### Stage 4: Giving and Receiving Feedback {#stage4}

Following submission of your first draft, all students will receive detailed feedback from the instructor, which will include critique of content, organization, and argument.
Additionally each student will complete an anonymous peer review of a fellow student's paper (your draft will also be peer reviewed).
Peer reviews will be blinded and only I (the instructor) will know which papers belong to which students.
Reviews will be assigned in class on **Monday, April 8.**
More details about providing an appropriate review and the formatting will be provided in class.
<u>Peer reviews are then due **Monday, April 22**</u> and will be re-distributed to authors by Wednesday, April 24 (*10% of literature review grade*).  

### Stage 5: Incorporating Feedback and Polishing Writing {#stage5}

You will receive comments from the instructor and from your peer reviewer via email on **Monday, April 22**.
You will then use these comments to revise your paper.
Your final paper must include a cover letter that details the changes you made to your draft based on feedback from me as well as from your peer reviewer.
<u>Additionally, all students should plan to meet with the TA during the weeks of April 22 and/or April 29 to review their feedback and discuss plans for revision.</u>
<u>The final draft of the literature review is due on **Friday, May 10 by 11:59 p.m.**</u> to ICON.
This will include the manuscript itself as well as a cover letter describing the changes made in response to comments from the instructor and the peer reviewer (*50% of literature review grade*).

# Grading {#grading}

Final grades will be assigned at the end of the semester on the basis of your total percentage of points earned on quizzes, examinations, written assignments, and lecture attendance.
Grades will be assigned on an absolute scale (criterion-referenced grading; see below); course grades will not be curved.
No extra-credit opportunities are available for this course.
Please note: As a matter of fairness to all students, I assign grades based on performance and do not negotiate grades.
Additionally, a penalty of 20% per day will be applied to all assignments turned in late.
Final grades will be assigned based on the following ranges:

| Grade | Percent |
|:------|:--------|
| A+    | 97â€“100% | 
| A     | 93â€“96   |
| A-    | 90â€“92   |
| B+    | 87â€“89   |
| B     | 83â€“86   |
| B-    | 80â€“82   |
| C+    | 77â€“79   |
| C     | 73â€“76   |
| C-    | 70â€“72   |
| D+    | 67â€“69   |
| D     | 63â€“66   |
| D-    | 60â€“62   |
| F     | 0â€“59    |

The relative contribution of each component to your final grade is as follows:
		
- 5%    Lecture Attendance					
- 10%   Literature Critiques (2 at 5% each)
- 20%   Exam 1 (Mid-Term)					
- 20%   Exam 2 (Final)						
- 15%   Quizzes (5 quizzes after dropping lowest quiz score, 3% each)
- 30%   Literature Review

# Date and Time of the Final Exam {#finalExam}

The final examination date and time will be announced by the Registrar generally by the fifth week of classes and it will be announced on the course ICON site once it is known.
<u>Do not plan your end of the semester travel plans until the final exam schedule is made public.
It is your responsibility to know the date, time, and place of the final exam.</u>
According to Registrar's final exam policy, students <u>have a maximum of two weeks after the announced final exam schedule</u> to request a change if an exam conflict exists or if a student has more than two exams in one day (see the [policy](https://registrar.uiowa.edu/makeup-final-examination-policies) here).

# Drop Deadline for this Course {#dropDeadline}

You can look up the [drop deadline for this course](https://registrar.uiowa.edu/course-deadlines) here.
When you drop a course, a "W" will appear on your transcript.
The mark of "W" is a neutral mark that does not affect your GPA.

You have the responsibility to help create such a classroom environment.
Please treat other students in the class, the TAs, and the instructor with respect.
Students are expected to help each other learn and to contribute overall to the learning environment of the course.
