# Asking for Help

Everyone needs help sometimesâ€”your classmates, your TAs, and your professor. And YOU.
We know that it can be anxiety-provoking to recognize that you need help and to ask for it.
And we also know that getting the help we need can make a big difference, both inside and outside the classroom.
So, we encourage you to reach out <u>quickly</u> for the help and support that you need!

# I need help with my mental or physical health...

- <u>If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide</u>, either call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988, or call 911.
- University Counseling Service: https://counseling.uiowa.edu/, or 319-335-7294
- Student Health: https://studentlife.uiowa.edu/departments/student-health/, or 319-335-8394

# I need help with academic accommodations...

- Student Disability Services (SDS) is available to help determine what academic accommodations may be available to you (e.g., notes, extra time for exams, scheduling accommodations, etc.).
- You can apply for student accommodations here: https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/accommodations/apply (call 319-335-1462 or email sds-info@uiowa.edu if questions!).
- We are happy to provide recommended accommodations as a part of this course, but we need a letter from SDS requesting them.

# I'm struggling and thinking about withdrawing...

- The ASRO office can be reached at uc-retention@uiowa.edu or (319) 335-1497.

# I need help with a crisis or emergency situation...

- Student Care & Assistance (https://dos.uiowa.edu/assistance/; 319-335-1162) provides assistance to students experiencing crisis and emergency situations.
These situations may include hospitalization, medical emergencies or long-term illness, mental health concerns, chronic conditions, death of a family member, natural disasters, off-campus living concerns, and unexpected events or challenges.

# I need help with this class...

Please come to Office Hours with one of the TAs or with Professor Petersen.
If you can't attend office hours, please email any of us to arrange a time to meet and discuss how best to help you move forward in the class.
We are all eager to talk with you and help you to succeed!
